== Info

image:https://travis-ci.org/danlangford/tableflipper.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/danlangford/tableflipper"]

A way for Dungeon Masters to collect, build, and roll on their collection of favorite tables.
the recursive template feature allows table results to mention dice rolls or other table results that all get resolved into one nice easy to read message.
currently it loads up tables from the 5e SRD.

== Tour

the `core` sub module is the meat and potatoes of the Table Flipping

the `cli` sub module is a command line interface

the `ui` sub module is a JavaFX interface

the `*-fatjar` modules bundle all dependencies into a single jar that is easier to run

the `*-jlink` modules were an attempt to use the new `jlink` feature and bundle the necessary JRE/JVM components into a single executable.

interesting Entry points (Main methods) to run:

    dan.langford.tableflipper.cli.TableFlipperCli
    dan.langford.tableflipper.ui.TableFlipperApp

== Requirements
    
you will need Java 11+ to run this. Maven 3.6+ is required to build this and that should be taken care of by the included maven wrapper `./mvnw`

TIP: you can obtain Java 11 from https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK], https://sdkman.io/[sdkman], or https://brew.sh/[Homebrew].

== Getting Started

run

    ./mvnw package

look for output

    [INFO] ----------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Reactor Summary for tableflipper 0.0.5:
    [INFO]
    [INFO] tableflipper ................... SUCCESS [  1.992 s]
    [INFO] tableflipper-core .............. SUCCESS [  2.285 s]
    [INFO] tableflipper-cli ............... SUCCESS [  0.264 s]
    [INFO] tableflipper-ui ................ SUCCESS [  0.305 s]
    [INFO] tableflipper-cli-fatjar ........ SUCCESS [  2.131 s]
    [INFO] tableflipper-ui-fatjar ......... SUCCESS [  2.623 s]
    [INFO] ----------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ----------------------------------------------------
 
now you can run

    java -jar target/tableflipper-cli-0.0.5.jar

or

    java -jar target/tableflipper-ui-0.0.5.jar

and copy those JARs to wherever you need them.

and at least in MacOS I can just double click the `tableflipper-ui-0.0.5.jar` to have it executed.

== Advanced

you can run the build with the `multiplatform` profile to have the ui fatjar include all the javafx graphics for all three platforms adding a few MB to the size. i still need to test that it actually works.

    ./mvnw package -Pmultiplatform
