    // i once saw something that explained an error i was seeing
    // there were some javafx issues and the resolution was to have a seperate class' main method
    // call over into the primary Application
    //the workaround worked
    // and then later i noticed i did not need this
    // so something changed. i dont know what
    // thats why this class remians for now

//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        TableFlipperApp.main(args);
//    }
