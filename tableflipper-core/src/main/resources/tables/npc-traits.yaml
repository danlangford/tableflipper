  npc-traits/physical:
    oneOf:
      - Bushy Sideburns (Obviously, this is funnier if it’s a female NPC.)
      - Noticeably Crooked Teeth (You can play this NPC with a touch of self-contiousness, like hiding their mouth when they talk, for example.)
      - Freckled
      - Missing 7th Finger (Adds a touch of mystery to the character.)
      - Scar from an Animal Attack (Perhaps this looks like 4 claw slashes.)
      - Single Braid in Beard (Add some beads. Why not?)
      - Missing Right Ear (Perhaps this is a badge of honor and they don’t try to hide it behind hair.)
      - Impeccably Dressed (Dapper, and this stands out amongst most others who are more casually dressed.)
      - Frizzy Hair
      - Heavily Perfumed (You don’t just catch a whiff, it almost knocks you over.)
      - Grey Eyes
      - Thin and Wiry
  npc-traits/personality:
    oneOf:
      - Intolerant Toward Others (Toward other races, other professions, other cases, or perhaps other beliefs.)
      - Enthusiastic (Every conversation is predictably encouraging and optimistic.)
      - Well-Spoken (Makes you wonder where their education came from.)
      - Man of Few Words (This NPC isn’t withholding, it’s just that every answer is just one word or so.)
      - Jealous (of the PCs)
      - Mean to Commoners or Service Staff
      - Compassionate (Perhaps you catch them given coppers to beggar kids or they ask you to show mercy.)
      - Bloodthirsty (Consistently pushing PCs into a fight with bandits, goblins, whoever…)
      - Studious (Asks questions. Considers answers. Wants to understand fully and willing to take the time to get to the truth.)
      - Polite and Patient
      - Weak-willed (You get a sense that this NPC gets pushed around often.)
      - Concerned (You might be able to use this as a hook for a side quest or encounter.  What is he or she concerned about?  A lost item or person?  An unsettling stranger in town?  Maybe they’re concerned for the PCs because they overheard a group of ruffians planning violence towards them.)
