  npc-traits/physical:
    roll: 1d12
    results:
      1: Bushy Sideburns (Obviously, this is funnier if it’s a female NPC.)
      2: Noticeably Crooked Teeth (You can play this NPC with a touch of self-contiousness, like hiding their mouth when they talk, for example.)
      3: Freckled
      4: Missing 7th Finger (Adds a touch of mystery to the character.)
      5: Scar from an Animal Attack (Perhaps this looks like 4 claw slashes.)
      6: Single Braid in Beard (Add some beads. Why not?)
      7: Missing Right Ear (Perhaps this is a badge of honor and they don’t try to hide it behind hair.)
      8: Impeccably Dressed (Dapper, and this stands out amongst most others who are more casually dressed.)
      9: Frizzy Hair
      10: Heavily Perfumed (You don’t just catch a whiff, it almost knocks you over.)
      11: Grey Eyes
      12: Thin and Wiry
  npc-traits/personality:
    roll: 1d12
    results:
      1: Intolerant Toward Others (Toward other races, other professions, other cases, or perhaps other beliefs.)
      2: Enthusiastic (Every conversation is predictably encouraging and optimistic.)
      3: Well-Spoken (Makes you wonder where their education came from.)
      4: Man of Few Words (This NPC isn’t withholding, it’s just that every answer is just one word or so.)
      5: Jealous (of the PCs)
      6: Mean to Commoners or Service Staff
      7: Compassionate (Perhaps you catch them given coppers to beggar kids or they ask you to show mercy.)
      8: Bloodthirsty (Consistently pushing PCs into a fight with bandits, goblins, whoever…)
      9: Studious (Asks questions. Considers answers. Wants to understand fully and willing to take the time to get to the truth.)
      10: Polite and Patient
      11: Weak-willed (You get a sense that this NPC gets pushed around often.)
      12: Concerned (You might be able to use this as a hook for a side quest or encounter.  What is he or she concerned about?  A lost item or person?  An unsettling stranger in town?  Maybe they’re concerned for the PCs because they overheard a group of ruffians planning violence towards them.)
